Just copy the desired language folder to the root directory of the executable file, "LangEasy.exe". The program will then be translated (exceptions are the help file and some hard-coded text).

If you want to translate this software, then please use LSACreator:
http://www.tbs-apps.com/lsacreator/download/

Next, send your translate DLL (and your language code) into a new issue on the project's website:
