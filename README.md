# LangEasy

## Prerequisite

Please make sure you have the [.NET Framework 4.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=17851) (or later) installed.

## Introduction

LangEasy is a language learning helper application (for Windows). It can be used to memorize vocabulary, expressions or 
even sentences. The program's main function is to learn one language; from the base language to the target 
language, you can give definitions in simple text files.

LangEasy is for the language student who requires some drilling, but it is by no means a substitute for learning.
It is not meant to teach you writing systems, grammar, or any complicated language nuances.
Rather, LangEasy serves as an aid to memorize and learn small words (and perhaps, definitions and sentences).

If you have no resources at your fingertip, then the help file explains you how to use the bundled resources
to generate some for your desired use case. For example, from English base resources you can translate into many other languages with Google 
Translate's document translation service.

## Why use this?

LangEasy's main feature lies in its two choice tests and the fact that you can also use audio files related for particular words (or use Google TTS if you have no such files or recording available). LangEasy relies on Google TTS for this (which may only download a few audio files at a time), which requires net 
connection. That being said, after the audio has been downloaded (or kept in the audio folder), no net 
connection is needed to download it again.

I understand that *Anki* exists, and that may be the preferable choice for many. However, for those not too keen on regulating themselves to such an extent (the likes of me), LangEasy can be an alternative choice.
